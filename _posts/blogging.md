I find that I learn some interesting things through my work and other experiences that I want to share with other people.

**Yes**, I'm using [Twitter Bootstrap](//twitter.github.com/bootstrap). It's a great little library, highly extensible, and I use it *every day* anyway.

This blog is powered by [Poet](//jsantell.github.com/poet/). It's a simple NodeJS blog plugin. In fact, this entire website is running on an [Express server](//expressjs.com/).

Right now, I'm trying to keep this blogging platform / website **as simple as possible**. It's just a standard Express server, the Poet module, jQuery 1.8.2, and Twitter Bootstrap. This list will probably expand to include [Less](//lesscss.org), [Coffeescript](//coffeescript.org), and who knows what else.
